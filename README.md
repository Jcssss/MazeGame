# MazeGame
A web-based game in which players must avoid enemies and excape the maze. This application was programmed using Javascript and HTML Canvas.

## About
This program first began as a random maze generator. Each maze was randomly generated using a randomized DFS algorithm. Eventually, I added a game based feature along with the ability to alter the maze size.
